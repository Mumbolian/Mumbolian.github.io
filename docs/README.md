# Docs

This directory contains planning and design docs that sit alongside the live nap planner at `https://t-man.net`.

Primary docs:

- `ios-app-implementation-plan.md` — detailed, phased plan for building a native SwiftUI iOS app that mirrors the production web app.
- `architecture.md` — high-level overview of the current web app architecture and scheduling engine.

Related technical/design docs (currently kept at repo root):

- `UNIFIED_LP_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — deep dive on the unified adjustment algorithm used to satisfy constraints.
- `BUGFIX_WAKE_WINDOW_LIMITS.md` — notes on the change that made wake-window parameters hard biological limits.

Over time, any new long-form notes or specs should be added under `docs/` rather than at the repo root.
